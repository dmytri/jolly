# Captain Notes

Captain-only notes: product framing, rationale, open questions, and current state. **Non-binding.**

Only Captain may read or edit this file. QM, Crew, and Bosun must not. Binding behavior lives in `features/*.feature` and referenced `assets/**`, never here.

> **Captain authors every `.feature` scenario** — read and follow `SCENARIO_WRITING.md` (the scenario-writing guide) for each one.

## Current state / next outbound

- **Done (commit `feb52f8`, local-only, ahead of origin by 1):** the entire v1 new-behavior worklist (10 scenarios / 43 steps) is now executable AND satisfied. QM scaffolded the step defs; Crew implemented the production code. `cucumber-js -p logic` green (93 passed, 0 failed); `--dry-run` 0 undefined; typecheck clean. Specifics:
  - `008` "stored, not verified" — store/app-token/stripe now report a stored-but-unverified value as exactly that phrase; app-token no longer claims "created"/"acquired". `create --dry-run` previews already existed (passed once scaffolded).
  - `009` generic-fallback — `commandInit` now reports `data.detectedAgent` (null/generic when no marker); the multi-agent matrix stays `@iteration`.
  - `012` `ENVIRONMENT_LIMIT_REACHED` — src already emitted the code; a limit-rejecting in-process Cloud API fixture exercises it.
  - `020` first-party-hosts — new `src/lib/hosts.ts` declares the canonical `FIRST_PARTY_HOSTS` allowlist + `isFirstPartyHost` predicate (honors `*.saleor.cloud` and the `JOLLY_SALEOR_CLOUD_API_URL` override); the test also greps src to forbid api.vercel.com / retired hosts.
- **Pushed:** commit `feb52f8` is on `origin/main` (dk approved, trunk-based). Deck clean at push.
- **Done (commit `7484eb5`, pushed to `origin/main` as of `48c0cd9`; dk approved, trunk-based):** the 020 first-party-host allowlist is now ENFORCED, not just declared. New `@logic` scenario `020:72` "Jolly refuses a request to a non-first-party host instead of sending it" is executable and green: `jolly create app-token --url https://evil.example.com/graphql/ --json` refuses **pre-flight** with the stable code `NON_FIRST_PARTY_HOST`, names the refused host, and writes nothing — no silent foreign request. Crew wired `isFirstPartyHost` into the `graphqlFetch` request seam (`src/lib/cloud-api.ts`) via an `assertFirstPartyUrl` guard that throws before any fetch; the legitimate 127.0.0.1 / *.saleor.cloud flows (and the `APP_TOKEN_ACQUISITION_FAILED` path) stay untouched. Verified by Captain: feature 020 = 10 scenarios/78 steps pass; `-p logic` = 94 scenarios/676 steps pass; `--dry-run` 0 undefined; typecheck clean.
  - **Open follow-up (architectural, non-blocking):** the guard sits only at `graphqlFetch` — the seam the customer-supplied `--url` flows through. Sibling seams (`cloudFetch`, `pollTaskStatus`, `timedGraphql`) currently receive only internally-derived first-party URLs and are unguarded; no scenario exercises them, so guarding them now would be behavior beyond spec. If a future scenario ever lets a customer-supplied host reach those seams, centralize the predicate at the one canonical request choke point rather than spreading `assertFirstPartyUrl` calls.
  - `002` deployed-storefront serves catalog + cart — `@sandbox`, gated on `HARNESS_DEPLOYED_STOREFRONT_URL` + the served store's endpoint; steps are defined and skip-not-fail locally (no live deploy to point at). Not part of `7484eb5`; awaits the live acceptance pass below.
- **Remaining outbound work:** publish `@dk/jolly@0.6.1`, then run one real paste→live-store acceptance pass on a clean machine to the feature 002 operational-readiness bar — deployed URL works, browsing/cart against Saleor Cloud, checkout reaches the Stripe test payment step, and `jolly doctor` checkout probe passes. Prefer a fresh blank Saleor environment; a non-blank store makes configurator deploy block honestly instead of applying.
- **Done (commit `ec28720`, local-only):** the orphaned step-definition re-sync to the audit-reworded scenarios — assertions preserved, no behavior change; 44 orphaned step defs pruned. Undefined steps 448 → 212. `cucumber-js -p logic` green (84 passed, 0 failed); typecheck clean.
- **New-behavior worklist (the 212 undefined) — v1-scope triage.** The audit also *added* genuinely-new scenarios beyond rewording, with no implementation. Triaged against the launch bar + MVP-first:
  - **V1 (on the launch-bar path / non-negotiable honesty+trust):**
    - `002` deployed storefront serves catalog + working cart — the launch bar; acceptance/@sandbox.
    - `008` "stored, not verified" + `create --dry-run` preview — honesty on the create stages setup uses; impl likely exists (QM scaffolding).
    - `012` `ENVIRONMENT_LIMIT_REACHED` — real store-creation failure; src already emits the code, needs a fixture.
    - `020` first-party-hosts allowlist — trust/security contract under the homepage handoff.
    - `009` generic-fallback detection only ("no marker → generic glue") — the baseline single-agent path.
  - **Defer to iteration (breadth / robustness / blocked):**
    - `009` multi-agent detection matrix (opencode/.cursor/.zed/.pi/…) + first-match order — breadth across 7 envs.
    - `006` exact command surface, global-flag matrix, old-Node launcher error, "@dk/jolly-only" naming — surface-stability/robustness.
    - `007` failed-skill-install surfacing — error-path robustness.
    - `017` auto-apply safe skill update — post-setup maintenance, not launch-bar (YAGNI). **Now unblocked:** safety rule decided and written into feature 017 — auto-apply only when it would not overwrite user-authored content; a customer-modified managed target is reported for review, never overwritten; Paper/storefront migrations never auto-applied. Iteration writes the negative scenario.
    - `018` `login --browser` → `--token` guidance — narrow auth-UX edge; agent path already uses `--token`.
    - `003` Paper guidance preservation-in-plan — minor plan-detail assertion; removed as a step from the v1 "Use Saleor Paper as the storefront baseline" scenario, to be re-specified as a dedicated iteration scenario.
    - `002` resume-skip already-completed storefront — resumability robustness (feature 022).
  - **Deferral mechanism (done):** deferred scenarios tagged `@iteration`; `cucumber.js` default/logic/sandbox profiles now exclude `@iteration`, and `-p iteration` runs the backlog. v1 worklist (default dry-run) = 10 scenarios / 43 steps across 002/008/009/012/020. Backlog: 43 scenarios under `-p iteration`. *(Tooling follow-up: AGENTS.md's "Test tiers" list still documents only @logic/@sandbox/@eval — add an `@iteration` line there; not done under the Captain/AGENTS.md boundary.)*

## File-placement principle

- `features/*.feature` + `assets/**` = product intent (binding). `CAPTAIN.md` = non-binding notes. `AGENTS.md` = Shipshape/tooling-generic agent config (no product specifics, bar unavoidable tooling identifiers like `@dk/jolly`, `JOLLY_*`). `CLAUDE.md` = thin Claude-Code-specific pointer to `AGENTS.md`.
- All test/harness methodology lives in `AGENTS.md` so QM/Crew always see it — the tiers, *prefer sandbox over mocks*, *harmless-by-design*, the sandbox provisioning/teardown mechanics, and *specs map to executable steps, no design notes as steps*. There is no harness/`@meta` feature: `features/**` describes how Jolly works, never the harness or test methodology.

## Goals & MVP framing (the real objective)

- **North star:** an agent takes a customer from a homepage prompt to a real, live, honest storefront — and the customer's own agent owns it afterward. Success is defined by the launch bar below, not by feature count.
- **MVP first, then iterate:** ship one clean, honest end-to-end path before breadth. Don't over-engineer or chase edge cases the first run won't hit — get paste→live-store working, then iterate. Setup is v1; the iteration phase (feature 019) comes after.
- **Honesty is non-negotiable:** never fabricate success. "Verified", `pass` checks, and success claims only for work actually performed and confirmed; unverified work says so; unimplemented paths error honestly. This is the trust the whole product rests on (enforced as behavior in features 018/020).
- **Empower, don't replace, the agent:** Jolly does deterministic plumbing and orchestrates the official CLIs; the customer's agent stays in charge — approves risk, completes human gates, owns the store after setup.
- **Audience:** AI agents/skills are the primary consumers; human DX stays decent but secondary.

## Product identity (non-binding)

- Name: Jolly. Tagline: "Ahoy, agent. Go build a store."
- A tool by Dmytri Kleiner to help an agent set up a Saleor + Vercel + Stripe store fast. Not an official product of Saleor, Vercel, or Stripe.
- Product shape: homepage + thin CLI + Jolly skill + Saleor agent-skills.
- **Launch bar** (when v1 is good enough to ship): homepage prompt → real deployed storefront → browsing/cart against Saleor Cloud → checkout reaches the Stripe test payment step, every claim verified, nothing fabricated.

## Architecture framing (non-binding; behavior is specified in features 002/008)

- `jolly start` is agent-supervised orchestration: it runs the mechanical stages by spawning the official CLIs and Jolly helpers, pauses for approval/risk context, and waits at human gates. The ordered stages and their contracts are specified in features 002 and 008 — not enumerated here.
- Human-run `jolly start` is the backup path for interactive gates a non-TTY agent cannot complete. The homepage stays paste-to-agent first.

## Open questions (deferred out of features)

- `features/001`: whether Jolly should create project-local durable artifacts such as `.jolly/` reports or state; exact per-environment setup steps for supported agent targets.
- `features/008`: whether `jolly create app-token` should request all available permissions or allow the agent to specify a subset.
- `features/012`: which pasted URL forms Jolly should normalize in v1; exact Saleor API or Dashboard automation path for app-token creation; exact task-status response shape and domain extraction against the live Cloud API.
- `features/019`: mcp-graphql config format for each supported agent environment; whether `jolly doctor --watch` belongs in v1 or v2; upgrade cadence signal for outdated skills.
- `features/020`: envelope schema versioning; canonical registry of stable error codes and check ids.
- `features/021`: whether `riskLevel` is derived deterministically from categories or set per action; optional fields such as estimated cost or affected record counts.
- `features/022`: how Jolly detects completed remote work, and whether resumable state is tracked in local artifacts such as `.jolly/`.
- `features/023`: CI wiring for sandbox credentials.

## Non-binding notes

- The product stack is specified in features, not restated here: Paper storefront + Vercel (002), Saleor Cloud only / no self-hosted (003), the configurator starter recipe (004), Stripe test mode only (005).
- Post-setup customization belongs to the customer's own agent/workflow.
- Homepage/setup-guide copy principle: less is more; avoid junk and duplication.
- Open future item: the npm tarball is large because `assets/skills/jolly/images/` ships product PNGs referenced by the starter recipe — functional, but worth future assets work.
- Forward goal (not built): step-result caching so unchanged verification is not re-run and status returns fast. The logic tier already runs in parallel (`cucumber.js`); caching needs a mechanism + invalidation rules, reporting cache-backed vs fresh, and must never hide a real failure.
- Future plan: extract the AGENTS.md "Scenario-writing rubric" (currently a faked-skill section — concrete-not-abstract, no faux steps, assert the system not the actor, verify invariants per-site, affordances via `pi`) into a standalone reusable scenario-writing skill — project-local first, then upstream to Shipshape — and use it to audit ALL existing scenarios against the rubric in one pass. That audit absorbs the still-open items: distributing per-mutation idempotency out of feature 022, the ~87 faux/weak step defs, and the vague-subject scenarios.
